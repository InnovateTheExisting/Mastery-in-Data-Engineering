Amazon S3 will store the dataset.

We rent a cluster of machines, i.e., our Spark Cluster, and iti s located in AWS data centers. We rent these using AWS service called 
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).

We log in from your local computer to this Spark cluster.

Upon running our Spark code, the cluster will load the dataset from Amazon S3 into the clusterâ€™s memory distributed across each machine 
in the cluster.
